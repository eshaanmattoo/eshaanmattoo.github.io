     This year has been terrific! I wish I knew this sooner but, "you got to respect yorself first".
     I just can't believe that corona started in 2020 and it's going to be two whole
     years!!!! I miss the old Eshaan, but sadly he's dead, there's this one new
     Eshaan who is Social to some extent but is highly suspicious of everyone.
     <br>
     Remember Aurangzeb? He was the most pious Mughal ruler, but in the end, he died alone.
     One of his last letters to his son gives us an insight that he was lost somewhere,
     he didn't know about anything and he was alone!<br>
     And I read somewhere that it is the fate of all great minds to live alone,
     But I'm not great, and I'm not alone, I'm just lonely. But that doesnt matter.
     <br>
     I was thinking of making a new website, as now I've discovered how a dynamic website works.
     The idea is terrific, you use a backend app to dynamically modify your data!
     I've chosen django for this, as I know the basics of python and its quite easy to
     get started with. Django is a web framework that revolves around python. But it's quite
     frustating to get started. And it's taking a lot of time, but i'll start with it!
     <br> I'm so busy yet so free, maybe im anxious or something, but I believe in him.
     and he never betrays!!!!!!!
