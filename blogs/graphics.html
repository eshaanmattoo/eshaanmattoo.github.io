      Heres the catch, i just used SVG(vector graphics) to make the footer,
      added some social media hyperlinks, overall its a good experience<br />
      I was also looking forward to use some iframes inorder to use media, but
      as the whole projects revolves around personal blogging I think its better
      to keep everything simple. Theres a lot of work to do but I am excited,
      overall developement: GOOD
      <br />
      Heres a quote to boost your confidence:<br />
      <i>"What you seek is seeking you" ~Rumi</i><br />
      The most fascinating thing about this poet is that he was once a scholar,
      but shams of tabriz actually changed his perspective, A dear friend of
      mine suggested me to read a book titled
      <i>"The Forty Rules Of Love"</i> and it was out of this world..<br />
      Sometimes I think of the world as everlasting, and the very next moment I
      hate it, the problem is not caused by my mood swings, but the basic fact
      that everything is temporary, everything, and everyone. That is definetely
      sad but the ONLY true reality of this world!<br />
      THAT'S IT FOR TODAY, SEE YA! ADIOS.<br /><br />
