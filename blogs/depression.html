      The teenage years are also called <strong>adolescence</strong>. This is a
      time for growth spurts and puberty changes. Adolescents experience rapid
      physical, cognitive and psychological growth, this affects how they feel,
      think, make decisions, and interact with the world around them. Being an
      adolescent means struggling with identity and self-image and being
      accepted by friends feels extremely important. Teenage can be very fun,
      memorable and exciting but it can also be a time in your life when you are
      in confusion and conflict, and that’s completely normal.<br />
      Sometimes teens will find themselves going through an emotional roller
      coaster, going from joy to sorrow, anger to sadness in a matter of
      minutes, feeling as if they’re losing their grip on life, but why are
      these mood swings so common among teens? The most important cause for mood
      swings is biology; the onset of puberty is marked by rapid physical and
      mental development. The body starts manufacturing sex hormones- oestrogen
      and progesterone in girls and testosterone in boys, and these hormones
      cause physical changes in our body, and as you might’ve guessed it, these
      also contribute largely to the emotional changes-the ups and downs that
      sometimes feel out of control.<br /><br />
      Most of the time, these rapid mood shifts are a normal part of
      adolescence. But for some teens, the lows are more than just temporary
      feelings — they're a symptom of depression. Depression, also known as
      major depressive disorder, is a mood disorder that makes you feel constant
      sadness or lack of interest in life. It's not unusual for a teen to be
      laughing one minute and crying their guts out the next. It is very
      important to look for the symptoms, for it can lead to alcohol and drug
      abuse, academic problems, family conflicts and relationship extremities,
      and the most tragic of them all: suicide. For teens, issues such as peer
      pressure, high academic expectations from parents, and the growing body
      and mind can bring highs and lows, but at the end of the day, it's all
      part of growing up!<br /><br />
      According to the World Health Organisation, 322 million people (4.4% of
      the total world population) suffer from depression. Over the years it is
      recognised that the age of onset of depression is decreasing, and it is
      now increasingly being recognised in adolescents. In India, 15 people
      commit suicide every hour! A Unicef report claims that one in seven
      Indians between 15-24 years of age feels depressed. The report further
      claimed that Only 41 per cent of 15 to 24-year-olds in India said it is
      good to get support for mental health problems. The Indian Journal of
      Psychiatry in 2019 stated that at least 50 million children in India were
      affected by mental health issues with 80 to 90 per cent not having sought
      support.<br /><br />
      The Unicef report also noted that even before the COVID-19 crisis,
      children and young people carried the burden of mental health conditions
      without significant investment in addressing them. Children in India have
      been through a challenging time living through the risks and restrictions
      posed by the pandemic. Nothing could have prepared them for the onslaught
      of the second wave of the pandemic that hit India earlier this year.
      Children witnessed suffering and uncertainties that no child should have
      to see. Being away from family, friends, classrooms and play caused
      isolation and anxiety. Children have not only been living an emotional
      tragedy, but many are also at a higher risk of neglect and abuse. Children
      get more overwhelmed now with disruptions in their life than they did
      earlier. Panic attacks have become very common in school children. There
      has been a rise in the number of cases related to body shaming as well.
      Children are increasingly involved in activities where they sit at home,
      instead of playing physically, or are involved in performance sports at
      all times. Homes, where rhythms are disturbed due to parents and their
      hectic lives, can lead to a lack of resilience in children, and can even
      lead to psychological disturbances. Anxiety, panic attacks, anger
      management issues, adjustment disorders, suicidal intentions and
      addictions are all behaviours that we see on the rise.<br /><br />
      Wide gaps persist between mental health needs and mental health funding.
      India has spent only 0.05 per cent of its health budget on mental health,
      according to the journal in 2017. While the impact on children's lives is
      incalculable, the economic loss due to mental health conditions between
      2012-2030 is estimated to be a whopping USD 1.03 trillion in India,
      according to WHO 2020!<br /><br />
      <strong>So what can we do?</strong><br /><br />
      Firstly, we need to break the stigma of talking about mental health and
      seeking support so that children can have better life outcomes. We must
      change the way we view mental health. Second, with the help of parents and
      counsellors, mental morbidity among children can effectively be handled.
      Parents, in particular, must be more aware of factors that lead to mental
      health disorders and provide a supportive environment to the young.
      Protective factors, such as loving caregivers, safe school environments,
      and positive peer relationships can also help reduce the risk of mental
      disorders. Third, address the need for standards; according to some
      estimates, India has less than one psychiatrist for every 100,000 people.
      To top it off, there is no assessment of counsellors. Fourth, to grow and
      develop in good health, adolescents need information, including
      age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education; opportunities to
      develop life skills; health services that are acceptable, equitable,
      appropriate and effective; and safe and supportive environments. They also
      need opportunities to meaningfully participate in the design and delivery
      of interventions to improve and maintain their health. Expanding such
      opportunities is key to responding to adolescents’ specific needs and
      rights.<br /><br />
