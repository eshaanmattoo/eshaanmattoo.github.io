    <h1 style="text-align: center">Who is 'Who' and what is 'what'?</h1>
    <p>
      'Who' is 'what' in 'which' sense? 'Who' is worthy of everything? 'Who' is
      worthy in it's truest forms? Who is 'Who'? and What is 'what'? <br />
      'Who' decides who should die? 'Who' decides who should live? 'Who' decides
      'what' who should have?<br />
      Should 'you' and 'I' decide what who should have?<br />
      You didn't understand a word of what I just said, but that's okay.
      <br />
      These terms, 'who', 'what', 'you', and 'I' are relative. You might
      conclude that they are abstract, or you might argue that they are
      not-abstract(considering you understood a word of what I said) moreover,
      do 'you' and 'I ' really exist?<br />

      <strong
        >You will think that you are right, and I will think I am right. There
        is no break to this vicious cycle and so this cycle continues. But who
        suffers in the end of this tragedy that we both created together? You
        will think You and I will think I. And if you don't understand this,
        then you will never understand anything.</strong
      ><br />
      To start with do 'we' really exist or are we just an idea? An idea in
      motion? Do 'we' really have emotions or we have subjective taste for
      subjectiveness? Does this world care if 'you' or 'I' really 'die'?<br />
      <br />
      Did you see that? I placed some words such as who, you, I, what, etc in
      quotes, and if you were paying close attention to each and every detail,
      your imagery must've been activated, congrats if it did and, well nothing
      to congratulate if it didn't.
      <br />
      This is how simple it is to play with the mind of a person. Keep them busy
      in some bullshit and they stop worrying about themselves. They will think
      that they are living in a real existent world but all they really are
      doing is liviing in their own self-made world.<br />

      <br />
      So Bullshit aside, never betray anyone. But don't have a soft corner in
      your 'heart' for anyone either.
