    <p>
      I remember, and I can never forget, on <i>shab-e-Qadr</i> I stayed up all
      night. I was weeping throughout the night. Not asking for mercy, not
      asking for <i>ilm</i>, not asking for peace. Instead a list of material
      tarnish things. But whatever I wished, indeed it was granted.<br />
      I had made a list of ten items, which I thought were the most important in
      my life, yes they were but to an extent. Starting the list with
      <strong>beauty</strong>, something that I had never felt, but I came to
      know later that how you look doesn't matter at all! The second thing that
      I wished for was <strong>respect</strong>, I am sure there are many more
      lessons that I have got to learn so.... I don't remember the others but
      one of them definetely was <strong>Compassion and love</strong>, and I had
      put a condition to that; Make them love me more than I love them, because
      I really never felt loved.<br />
      <strong><i>The wish was indeed granted</i></strong
      ><br />
      After all why not! It was shab-e-Qadr! And oh my! Allah was indeed
      showering his mercy on all of us. Boy, Did I taste love!<br />
      So sweet, just like a hump of sugar, starts to melt in your mouth. Feels
      like an endless fountain. The depth of world, the warmth of sun, so
      undescribable. You can only feel it, it cannot be expressed. A tentative
      estimate!<br />
      So would you keep that hump of sugar forever in your mouth? I would, if
      only the sugar was forever to stay! Correct me on this one if I'm wrong,
      is the sugar everlasting? NO! it is the taste that is everlasting! You
      only need the sugar when you want it in dish, say for example you want to
      make
      <i>halwa</i>, and you don't add any sugar to it, how will it taste? You
      will definetely feel an urge to add sugar to your <i>halwa</i> because you
      are accustomed to eating <i>halwa</i> sweet!
      <br />
      Similarly, we can conclude the same for human memories: The people leave,
      but memories stay.
      <br /><br />
      <!-- Sometimes a man is at croosroads in his life, and he expects love and
      Compassion from people. Give it to him and he becomes a subject of it.
      Deprive him of it, he becomes an untameable beast! Give or take I don't
      care about your opinion! -->
      As Aqib Shah says:<br /><i
        >"No light could ever replace her splendour<br />
        she is brilliant all along <br />
        Sometimes<br />
        She would be the sunset<br />
        lighting up the horizon<br />
        with orange hue,<br />
        and<br />
        Sometimes<br />
        she would become<br />
        the night sky<br />
        only to give<br />
        her Sun to the one<br />
        it rains on"</i
      ><br /><br />
      But all along, I failed to realise one simple thing, I had a compassionate
      friend watching my back all along, <i>Al-Hay Al-Haq, Ya-Raheem</i>.<br />
      What have I been tested with? Loss? seperation? Guilt? And what is that
      compared to what our messengers endured? <i>Nuh AS</i> invited his people
      for 900 years! nobody paid heed to him. <i>Yaqub AS</i>, lost his dear
      son, and for years he cried and cried until he lost his sight, and his own
      sons were the ones who had betrayed him.<i>Yusuf AS</i> was tested with
      betrayal by his own brothers, husn, and Lust! <i>Muhammad SAW</i> were
      also tested, and Allah was the one to test him! Wasn't He a piece from
      Allah's noor? Then why was he tested? Because Allah loved him and wanted
      to make an example out of him. So that we may learn and thrive. Because
      <i>with hardship comes ease and with more hardship comes more ease</i>.
      And it is known that Allah only tests those whom he loves!
      <br />
      So if anything is edurable, I simply endure it speechlessly. Because its
      an honor to be tested!
