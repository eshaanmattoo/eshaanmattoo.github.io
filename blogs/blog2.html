    <h1 style="text-align: center">A Lost Friend</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 23px">
      Consider yourself in a hypothetical position where you are so insecure
      about everything. Everything that revolves around you. You end up
      suspecting each and everything , you are so perturbed by everything, that
      your relationships with people start to strain. You go through mental
      trauma and depressive disorders, you are now nothing more than a dead body
      with no soul.<br /><br />
      You are revived by a Friend, a Friend that comes as a blessing, but this
      blessing has its own cons. <br /><br />
      What happens when you are attracted to something or someone so much, that
      even the thought of losing that thing or the person, takes all your
      happiness, rues your day and you start to think so much that you end up
      losing your mental peace and stability.<br />
      People call me crazy, ignorant, stupid, <i>dumbo</i>, and what not. But
      this one Friend, uf this friend is unexplainable. Sometimes I used to
      question myself every night, is this real? is this a dream? I was such a
      simpleton that I even prayed for my friend. oh and when we came close, I
      remember praying sujud ash-shukr I was so happy that I Glorify Allah in
      all his forms, "oh Allah i cannot thank you enough for what you've given
      me" . You might be thinking was I really this stupid, really? YES!
      <br />
      <br />
      I didn't know anything about philosophy and sufism until this very friend
      of mine suggested me to read "the forty rules of love" by Elif Shafak. And
      this very book just changed my perspective. The pinch to this story is
      that this friend of mine wont understand philosophy.<br /><br />

      <i>"Change is the only constant in life"</i> said by god knows who, but
      whoever said it, must've been very wise.
      <strong
        >Change is only thing that keeps us going, if we dont change, we dont
        survive </strong
      >as simple as that. Had I restricted my self to your company I would have
      never met my very own self. <br /><br />
      Life has been living hell for me, the past month has been so erratic, so
      confusing that even words cannot desciribe what I feel. No one is going to
      be there for you, even when they say it a thousand times. In the end you
      have to learn to love yourself becuase you are going to live with yourself
      for the rest of your life. When people get new friends they forget their
      old companion and move on and its better to keep only one companion and
      that is ALLAH. <br /><br />
      <i
        >"I have lived on the lip of insanity, wanting to know reasons, knocking
        on a door. It opens. I've been knocking from the inside."</i
      >
      How true is that? Let me tell you: IT'S PRETTY TRUE.<br /><br />
      Now everythingin rubble, does anything bother me anymore? YES and NO.
      <br />
      <!-- And if you are reading this Oh old friend, let me tell you, I have
      forgiven you but not forgotten. You might not know but one day you will,
      and you will regret that day.
      <br /> -->
      Your love indeed tasted like salt in the tea, <br />
      and I did not stash it away.<br />
      instead I felt it's warmth<br />
      till it was impossible to live without<br />
      But had I known this tea was so addictive,<br />
      I would've never taken a sip<br />
      becuase sip after sip<br />
      I drowned myself
